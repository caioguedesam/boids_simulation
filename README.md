# Boid Simulation

This is a simple boid/flocking behavior simulation, using C++ and OpenGL. This project was made as an assignment for the Computer Graphics course at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).

The scene consists of a main object (in green) being followed by a number of other objects (in blue), that adhere to flocking rules specified by parameters (separation, alignment, cohesion, follow main).

This project was made in legacy OpenGL, and may or may not be ported to modern OpenGL in the future.
